Unit testing is the smallest part of the software to be tested. In the unit testing, every single unit of the software is tested separately and it is usually done by the developer itself. In unit testing, we know the code we are testing so it is also known as "White box testing". 

Unit testing is like checking each block separately of a giant block puzzle. By checking each block separately doesn't mean that the whole block building will be made perfectly but the chance will be more. Similarly, Unit testing doesn't ensure that at the time of integration of all the units software will work properly but the errors will be more likely less.
