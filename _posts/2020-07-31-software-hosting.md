Hosting in the world of IT means that a software is installed and can now be accessed entirely from a remote location. Unlike most software that runs on user's local machine, the hosted software-related computing and data-processing is done on the remote machine and end user's access it using a compatible web browser or mobile application.

First of all the environment where the application is being hosted is created and required software to support the application are installed. Afterwards, files related to the software such as HTML files, application code, database files are deployed to specific servers in the environment.

Applications can be hosted either completely on-premises or on public cloud (like AWS and Azure). There can also be a hybrid model where some of the application components are hosted in a public cloud and some are hosted on-premises.
