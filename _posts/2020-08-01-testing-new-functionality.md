For testing a new functionality as a QA the below steps should be followed:

1.	Read the requirement document and understand all the user requirements related to that functionality
2.	Create test conditions and test cases according to the assessed requirements
3.	Prepare a Requirement Tracebality Matrix (RTM) to check prepared test cases have covered all the requirements
4.	Get all the test conditions and cases peer reviewed
5.	Get a Business Analyst (BA) walkthrough
6.	Execute the test cases and report the bugs (if found any)
7. Re-test the fixed bug 

And when all the bugs are fixed and re-tested the software is ready to be tested in UAT environment and after that ready for deployment in production environment.
