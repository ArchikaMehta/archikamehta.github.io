**Hello everyone**,

In this post I would describe the Software Devlopment process.

First we will understand why do we need a software get developed, the answer is simple to provide solution to any requirements. For example: because of some urgency or something else we don't want to go out for shopping, so for this requirement various online shopping portals like Amazon provide solution, without going out we can buy staff that will be delivered to our address.

Now how the Software gets developed, for this the person or an organization (let's call it Product owner) whoever have requirement for the software will approch the software development company or person(let's call it Solution provider). They both will discuss about the requirments and solution. In the further few meetings the solution provider will ask all details related to business requiremnts, budget, time frame for the devlopment process etc. The product owner will provide all the details asked for and with mutual understanding a detailed requirment document will be prepared.

With the help of requirmentnt document solution provider will discuss those requirement with his team, they will plan everything like what are the methodologies should be used for software development, other startegies to manage the timeline and budget requirements etc. After these planning sessions developers will start working on the development  of codes, after development codes will be send to QA testers for testing and quality checking, after quality check the software will be deployed to the end users by DevOps team and then at the last customer team will take care of the after deployment maintainance services.
