**Hello everyone**,

In this post I will be describing the Software Devlopment process.

Let's first understand why do we need to develop a software, the answer is simple to performs a specific personal, educational, or business function. For example: ecommerce websites provide a business function to enable users to shop from anywhere using the website or mobile app.

Now, let's see how the Software gets developed, for this the person or an organization (let's call it Product owner), whoever has a requirement for the software will approch the software development company or person(let's call it Solution provider). They both will discuss about the requirments and solution. In the further few meetings the solution provider will ask all details related to business requiremnts, budget, time frame for the devlopment process etc. The product owner will provide all the details asked for and with mutual understanding a detailed requirment document will be prepared.

With the help of requirmentnt document, the solution provider will discuss those requirements with their team and will plan everything like what methodologies should be used for software development, other startegies to manage the timeline and budget requirements etc. After these planning sessions developers will start working on developing the application by wrting code in the preferred programming language, after development codes will be sent to QA testers for testing and quality checking, after quality check the software is deployed to the end users by DevOps team and at in the end customer support team takes care of the after deployment maintainance services.
